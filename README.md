Email Address Mass Harvester
============================

Email Address Mass Harvester is a multi-threaded application that recursively searches through a specified folder for email addresses stored in config.ini filetype controlled text-based files. The email addresses harvested are matched to the user inputted email address pattern (e.g. @commerce.uct.ac.za). Multiple patterns can be defined using ;; as the delimiter string.
